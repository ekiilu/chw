Community Health Workers in the rural areas face a huge challenge of returning collected data back to
the health care centers for further analysis. The problem is made worse by the poor transportation
infrastructure in the rural areas.
This project entails with developing an SMS based system for use by the community health workers in
remote areas such as rural Kenya. The system aims to utilize SMS technology found on most mobile
phone devices to send data collected by CHWs back to the health centers in their location. The system
works by having registered CHWs send special commands to a mobile phone number associated with a
web based system; the commands are then analyzed by the system. From data analysis the system is
able to produce location based reporting based on different variables such as date and type of disease.
Generated reports can be used to support decision making by the health authorities in the concerned
areas; furthermore the reports can used as form of feedback by the CHWs to see their progress, in
supporting health care initiatives in their area.
The implementation of SMS based system for use by the community health workers was successful.
The developed System managed to fully utilize SMS technology on mobile phones and therefore
enabled helped Community Health workers in collecting and sending data to their respective health
centers effectively.
